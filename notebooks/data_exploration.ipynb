The term of this  Agreement  shall be ten (10)                            years (the \"Term\")  which shall  commence on the date                            upon which the Company  delivers to  Distributor  the                            last Sample, as defined  hereinafter.

Company  shall  promote  and                            advertise the Products generally, at its own expense,                            and   shall   furnish   Distributor   copies  at  all                            advertisement and promotional materials.\n\n                  1.5      The Distributor's Obligation.

In                            order  to  maintain  the  exclusive  rights  to sell,                            lease, distribute and service Products in the Market,                            the Distributor must use all commercially  reasonably                            efforts to purchase for sale to  subdistributors  the                            following minimum quantities of the Products from the                            Company:\n\n         On the  commencement of the Term  Distributor will issue to the Company an  irrevocable  letter of credit (\"LC\") in the amount of Five Hundred  Thousand Dollars  ($500,000),  the form of which is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A and incorporated  herein by reference.  The LC shall have a two (2) month term,  and shall be renewed  for five (5)  consecutive  bimonthly  periods.  A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.  The Company may draw funds from the LC to pay for  Distributor's  purchases,  which are not paid according to the terms in Section 2.7. Prices for the EnergySaver units are\n\n                                    Page -2-\n\nprovided  by the  Company as Exhibit C. The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.       PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS\n\n         2.1      Orders.  The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor.

A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.

Prices for the EnergySaver units are\n\n                                    Page -2-\n\nprovided  by the  Company as Exhibit C. The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.

The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.

Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.

The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.  Other than \"drop ship\"  deliveries,  all deliveries\n\n\n\n\n\n                  made  pursuant to this  Agreement  shall be FOB the  Company's                   facilities  located within the continental  United States by a                   carrier authorized by the Distributor.\n\n         2.4.

The Company  also  reserves  the right to                            increase  or  decrease  the price  per unit  based on                            Company   wide   changes   in  unit   prices  to  all                            distributors of the Company,  provided however,  that                            any price changes, other than those based on the CPI,                            shall be uniformly applied to all distributors of the                            Products   and  shall   reasonably   applied  to  all                            distributors  of the  Products  and shall  reasonably                            reflect Company's costs of manufacturing the Products                            and/or  market  demand  for  the  Products,  provided                            further  than any increase in price based upon market                            demand   shall   not  be  so  great  as  to   deprive                            Distributor  of  its  normal  and  customary   profit                            margin.  The Company agrees to exercise this right in                            good faith,  and  consider all  circumstances  of the                            Distributor  and the  Company.

Company  shall  promote  and                            advertise the Products generally, at its own expense,                            and   shall   furnish   Distributor   copies  at  all                            advertisement and promotional materials.\n\n                  1.5      The Distributor's Obligation. The Distributor, at its                            own expense,  shall promote the distribution,  sales,                            and use of Products in the Market.\n\n                  1.6      Distributor's  Terms  and  Minimum  Expectations.  In                            order  to  maintain  the  exclusive  rights  to sell,                            lease, distribute and service Products in the Market,                            the Distributor must use all commercially  reasonably                            efforts to purchase for sale to  subdistributors  the                            following minimum quantities of the Products from the                            Company:\n\n         On the  commencement of the Term  Distributor will issue to the Company an  irrevocable  letter of credit (\"LC\") in the amount of Five Hundred  Thousand Dollars  ($500,000),  the form of which is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A and incorporated  herein by reference.  The LC shall have a two (2) month term,  and shall be renewed  for five (5)  consecutive  bimonthly  periods.  A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.  The Company may draw funds from the LC to pay for  Distributor's  purchases,  which are not paid according to the terms in Section 2.7. Prices for the EnergySaver units are\n\n                                    Page -2-\n\nprovided  by the  Company as Exhibit C. The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.

The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.  Other than \"drop ship\"  deliveries,  all deliveries\n\n\n\n\n\n                  made  pursuant to this  Agreement  shall be FOB the  Company's                   facilities  located within the continental  United States by a                   carrier authorized by the Distributor.\n\n         2.4.

The term of this  Agreement  shall be ten (10)                            years (the \"Term\")  which shall  commence on the date                            upon which the Company  delivers to  Distributor  the                            last Sample, as defined  hereinafter.

Company  shall  promote  and                            advertise the Products generally, at its own expense,                            and   shall   furnish   Distributor   copies  at  all                            advertisement and promotional materials.\n\n                  1.5      The Distributor's Obligation. The Distributor, at its                            own expense,  shall promote the distribution,  sales,                            and use of Products in the Market.\n\n                  1.6      Distributor's  Terms  and  Minimum  Expectations.  In                            order  to  maintain  the  exclusive  rights  to sell,                            lease, distribute and service Products in the Market,                            the Distributor must use all commercially  reasonably                            efforts to purchase for sale to  subdistributors  the                            following minimum quantities of the Products from the                            Company:\n\n         On the  commencement of the Term  Distributor will issue to the Company an  irrevocable  letter of credit (\"LC\") in the amount of Five Hundred  Thousand Dollars  ($500,000),  the form of which is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A and incorporated  herein by reference.  The LC shall have a two (2) month term,  and shall be renewed  for five (5)  consecutive  bimonthly  periods.  A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.

The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.

The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.  Other than \"drop ship\"  deliveries,  all deliveries\n\n\n\n\n\n                  made  pursuant to this  Agreement  shall be FOB the  Company's                   facilities  located within the continental  United States by a                   carrier authorized by the Distributor.\n\n         2.4.

The Company  also  reserves  the right to                            increase  or  decrease  the price  per unit  based on                            Company   wide   changes   in  unit   prices  to  all                            distributors of the Company,  provided however,  that                            any price changes, other than those based on the CPI,                            shall be uniformly applied to all distributors of the                            Products   and  shall   reasonably   applied  to  all                            distributors  of the  Products  and shall  reasonably                            reflect Company's costs of manufacturing the Products                            and/or  market  demand  for  the  Products,  provided                            further  than any increase in price based upon market                            demand   shall   not  be  so  great  as  to   deprive                            Distributor  of  its  normal  and  customary   profit                            margin.  The Company agrees to exercise this right in                            good faith,  and  consider all  circumstances  of the                            Distributor  and the  Company.

The term of this  Agreement  shall be ten (10)                            years (the \"Term\")  which shall  commence on the date                            upon which the Company  delivers to  Distributor  the                            last Sample, as defined  hereinafter.

Company  shall  promote  and                            advertise the Products generally, at its own expense,                            and   shall   furnish   Distributor   copies  at  all                            advertisement and promotional materials.\n\n                  1.5      The Distributor's Obligation.

In                            order  to  maintain  the  exclusive  rights  to sell,                            lease, distribute and service Products in the Market,                            the Distributor must use all commercially  reasonably                            efforts to purchase for sale to  subdistributors  the                            following minimum quantities of the Products from the                            Company:\n\n         On the  commencement of the Term  Distributor will issue to the Company an  irrevocable  letter of credit (\"LC\") in the amount of Five Hundred  Thousand Dollars  ($500,000),  the form of which is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A and incorporated  herein by reference.  The LC shall have a two (2) month term,  and shall be renewed  for five (5)  consecutive  bimonthly  periods.  A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.  The Company may draw funds from the LC to pay for  Distributor's  purchases,  which are not paid according to the terms in Section 2.7. Prices for the EnergySaver units are\n\n                                    Page -2-\n\nprovided  by the  Company as Exhibit C. The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.

The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.

In                            order  to  maintain  the  exclusive  rights  to sell,                            lease, distribute and service Products in the Market,                            the Distributor must use all commercially  reasonably                            efforts to purchase for sale to  subdistributors  the                            following minimum quantities of the Products from the                            Company:\n\n         On the  commencement of the Term  Distributor will issue to the Company an  irrevocable  letter of credit (\"LC\") in the amount of Five Hundred  Thousand Dollars  ($500,000),  the form of which is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A and incorporated  herein by reference.  The LC shall have a two (2) month term,  and shall be renewed  for five (5)  consecutive  bimonthly  periods.  A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.  The Company may draw funds from the LC to pay for  Distributor's  purchases,  which are not paid according to the terms in Section 2.7. Prices for the EnergySaver units are\n\n                                    Page -2-\n\nprovided  by the  Company as Exhibit C. The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.

The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.  Other than \"drop ship\"  deliveries,  all deliveries\n\n\n\n\n\n                  made  pursuant to this  Agreement  shall be FOB the  Company's                   facilities  located within the continental  United States by a                   carrier authorized by the Distributor.\n\n         2.4.

The prices set forth in                            Section   2.4(a)  shall  be  subject  to   adjustment                            annually  on the  first  day  of  each  Product  Year                            beginning in the calendar  year 2000 and on the first                            day of each succeeding Product Year for the remainder                            of the Term and all  renewals  of this  Agreement  in                            proportion   to  the  increase  or  decrease  in  the                            Consumer  Price Index (CPI) as compared to the CPI as                            it  existed  on the  first  day of the  Term  of this                            Agreement.  The Company  also  reserves  the right to                            increase  or  decrease  the price  per unit  based on                            Company   wide   changes   in  unit   prices  to  all                            distributors of the Company,  provided however,  that                            any price changes, other than those based on the CPI,                            shall be uniformly applied to all distributors of the                            Products   and  shall   reasonably   applied  to  all                            distributors  of the  Products  and shall  reasonably                            reflect Company's costs of manufacturing the Products                            and/or  market  demand  for  the  Products,  provided                            further  than any increase in price based upon market                            demand   shall   not  be  so  great  as  to   deprive                            Distributor  of  its  normal  and  customary   profit                            margin.

The term of this  Agreement  shall be ten (10)                            years (the \"Term\")  which shall  commence on the date                            upon which the Company  delivers to  Distributor  the                            last Sample, as defined  hereinafter.

Company  shall  promote  and                            advertise the Products generally, at its own expense,                            and   shall   furnish   Distributor   copies  at  all                            advertisement and promotional materials.\n\n                  1.5      The Distributor's Obligation.

In                            order  to  maintain  the  exclusive  rights  to sell,                            lease, distribute and service Products in the Market,                            the Distributor must use all commercially  reasonably                            efforts to purchase for sale to  subdistributors  the                            following minimum quantities of the Products from the                            Company:\n\n         On the  commencement of the Term  Distributor will issue to the Company an  irrevocable  letter of credit (\"LC\") in the amount of Five Hundred  Thousand Dollars  ($500,000),  the form of which is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A and incorporated  herein by reference.  The LC shall have a two (2) month term,  and shall be renewed  for five (5)  consecutive  bimonthly  periods.  A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.  The Company may draw funds from the LC to pay for  Distributor's  purchases,  which are not paid according to the terms in Section 2.7. Prices for the EnergySaver units are\n\n                                    Page -2-\n\nprovided  by the  Company as Exhibit C. The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.       PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS\n\n         2.1      Orders.  The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.  Other than \"drop ship\"  deliveries,  all deliveries\n\n\n\n\n\n                  made  pursuant to this  Agreement  shall be FOB the  Company's                   facilities  located within the continental  United States by a                   carrier authorized by the Distributor.\n\n         2.4.

The term of this  Agreement  shall be ten (10)                            years (the \"Term\")  which shall  commence on the date                            upon which the Company  delivers to  Distributor  the                            last Sample, as defined  hereinafter.

A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.

Prices for the EnergySaver units are\n\n                                    Page -2-\n\nprovided  by the  Company as Exhibit C. The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.       PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS\n\n         2.1      Orders.  The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement.

In                            order  to  maintain  the  exclusive  rights  to sell,                            lease, distribute and service Products in the Market,                            the Distributor must use all commercially  reasonably                            efforts to purchase for sale to  subdistributors  the                            following minimum quantities of the Products from the                            Company:\n\n         On the  commencement of the Term  Distributor will issue to the Company an  irrevocable  letter of credit (\"LC\") in the amount of Five Hundred  Thousand Dollars  ($500,000),  the form of which is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A and incorporated  herein by reference.

A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.  The Company may draw funds from the LC to pay for  Distributor's  purchases,  which are not paid according to the terms in Section 2.7. Prices for the EnergySaver units are\n\n                                    Page -2-\n\nprovided  by the  Company as Exhibit C. The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.

The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.

Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.

The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.  Other than \"drop ship\"  deliveries,  all deliveries\n\n\n\n\n\n                  made  pursuant to this  Agreement  shall be FOB the  Company's                   facilities  located within the continental  United States by a                   carrier authorized by the Distributor.\n\n         2.4.

The Company  also  reserves  the right to                            increase  or  decrease  the price  per unit  based on                            Company   wide   changes   in  unit   prices  to  all                            distributors of the Company,  provided however,  that                            any price changes, other than those based on the CPI,                            shall be uniformly applied to all distributors of the                            Products   and  shall   reasonably   applied  to  all                            distributors  of the  Products  and shall  reasonably                            reflect Company's costs of manufacturing the Products                            and/or  market  demand  for  the  Products,  provided                            further  than any increase in price based upon market                            demand   shall   not  be  so  great  as  to   deprive                            Distributor  of  its  normal  and  customary   profit                            margin.  The Company agrees to exercise this right in                            good faith,  and  consider all  circumstances  of the                            Distributor  and the  Company.

The term of this  Agreement  shall be ten (10)                            years (the \"Term\")  which shall  commence on the date                            upon which the Company  delivers to  Distributor  the                            last Sample, as defined  hereinafter.

Company  shall  promote  and                            advertise the Products generally, at its own expense,                            and   shall   furnish   Distributor   copies  at  all                            advertisement and promotional materials.\n\n                  1.5      The Distributor's Obligation. The Distributor, at its                            own expense,  shall promote the distribution,  sales,                            and use of Products in the Market.\n\n                  1.6      Distributor's  Terms  and  Minimum  Expectations.  In                            order  to  maintain  the  exclusive  rights  to sell,                            lease, distribute and service Products in the Market,                            the Distributor must use all commercially  reasonably                            efforts to purchase for sale to  subdistributors  the                            following minimum quantities of the Products from the                            Company:\n\n         On the  commencement of the Term  Distributor will issue to the Company an  irrevocable  letter of credit (\"LC\") in the amount of Five Hundred  Thousand Dollars  ($500,000),  the form of which is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A and incorporated  herein by reference.  The LC shall have a two (2) month term,  and shall be renewed  for five (5)  consecutive  bimonthly  periods.  A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.

Prices for the EnergySaver units are\n\n                                    Page -2-\n\nprovided  by the  Company as Exhibit C. The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.       PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS\n\n         2.1      Orders.  The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.  Other than \"drop ship\"  deliveries,  all deliveries\n\n\n\n\n\n                  made  pursuant to this  Agreement  shall be FOB the  Company's                   facilities  located within the continental  United States by a                   carrier authorized by the Distributor.\n\n         2.4.

The Company  also  reserves  the right to                            increase  or  decrease  the price  per unit  based on                            Company   wide   changes   in  unit   prices  to  all                            distributors of the Company,  provided however,  that                            any price changes, other than those based on the CPI,                            shall be uniformly applied to all distributors of the                            Products   and  shall   reasonably   applied  to  all                            distributors  of the  Products  and shall  reasonably                            reflect Company's costs of manufacturing the Products                            and/or  market  demand  for  the  Products,  provided                            further  than any increase in price based upon market                            demand   shall   not  be  so  great  as  to   deprive                            Distributor  of  its  normal  and  customary   profit                            margin.  The Company agrees to exercise this right in                            good faith,  and  consider all  circumstances  of the                            Distributor  and the  Company.

Distributor also  acknowledges  that if its customers                            have  sites,  locations  or  operations  outside  the                            Market,   in  the   market   of   another   exclusive                            distributor of the Products,  those customers will be                            required to  purchase  products  from the  applicable                            exclusive  distributor  in  that  market;  otherwise,                            Distributor shall be free to sell to its customers in                            any  market  which  does not have  another  exclusive                            distributor.\n\n                  1.2      License.

The term of this  Agreement  shall be ten (10)                            years (the \"Term\")  which shall  commence on the date                            upon which the Company  delivers to  Distributor  the                            last Sample, as defined  hereinafter.

All renewals of this  Agreement  shall be on the same                            terms and conditions as are set forth herein.\n\n                  1.4      Company's Obligation.  Company shall sell and deliver                            as  provided  in  Section  2.3 of this  Agreement  to                            Distributor  on the  price  terms  set  forth in this                            Agreement  or as  amended  from  time  to  time  such                            quantity of Products as Distributor from time to time                            orders  from  Company.   Company  shall  promote  and                            advertise the Products generally, at its own expense,                            and   shall   furnish   Distributor   copies  at  all                            advertisement and promotional materials.\n\n                  1.5      The Distributor's Obligation. The Distributor, at its                            own expense,  shall promote the distribution,  sales,                            and use of Products in the Market.\n\n                  1.6      Distributor's  Terms  and  Minimum  Expectations.  In                            order  to  maintain  the  exclusive  rights  to sell,                            lease, distribute and service Products in the Market,                            the Distributor must use all commercially  reasonably                            efforts to purchase for sale to  subdistributors  the                            following minimum quantities of the Products from the                            Company:\n\n         On the  commencement of the Term  Distributor will issue to the Company an  irrevocable  letter of credit (\"LC\") in the amount of Five Hundred  Thousand Dollars  ($500,000),  the form of which is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A and incorporated  herein by reference.  The LC shall have a two (2) month term,  and shall be renewed  for five (5)  consecutive  bimonthly  periods.  A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.  The Company may draw funds from the LC to pay for  Distributor's  purchases,  which are not paid according to the terms in Section 2.7. Prices for the EnergySaver units are\n\n                                    Page -2-\n\nprovided  by the  Company as Exhibit C. The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.       PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS\n\n         2.1      Orders.  The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.  Other than \"drop ship\"  deliveries,  all deliveries\n\n\n\n\n\n                  made  pursuant to this  Agreement  shall be FOB the  Company's                   facilities  located within the continental  United States by a                   carrier authorized by the Distributor.\n\n         2.4.

The Company  also  reserves  the right to                            increase  or  decrease  the price  per unit  based on                            Company   wide   changes   in  unit   prices  to  all                            distributors of the Company,  provided however,  that                            any price changes, other than those based on the CPI,                            shall be uniformly applied to all distributors of the                            Products   and  shall   reasonably   applied  to  all                            distributors  of the  Products  and shall  reasonably                            reflect Company's costs of manufacturing the Products                            and/or  market  demand  for  the  Products,  provided                            further  than any increase in price based upon market                            demand   shall   not  be  so  great  as  to   deprive                            Distributor  of  its  normal  and  customary   profit                            margin.  The Company agrees to exercise this right in                            good faith,  and  consider all  circumstances  of the                            Distributor  and the  Company.

A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.

The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.

The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.

The prices set forth in                            Section   2.4(a)  shall  be  subject  to   adjustment                            annually  on the  first  day  of  each  Product  Year                            beginning in the calendar  year 2000 and on the first                            day of each succeeding Product Year for the remainder                            of the Term and all  renewals  of this  Agreement  in                            proportion   to  the  increase  or  decrease  in  the                            Consumer  Price Index (CPI) as compared to the CPI as                            it  existed  on the  first  day of the  Term  of this                            Agreement.  The Company  also  reserves  the right to                            increase  or  decrease  the price  per unit  based on                            Company   wide   changes   in  unit   prices  to  all                            distributors of the Company,  provided however,  that                            any price changes, other than those based on the CPI,                            shall be uniformly applied to all distributors of the                            Products   and  shall   reasonably   applied  to  all                            distributors  of the  Products  and shall  reasonably                            reflect Company's costs of manufacturing the Products                            and/or  market  demand  for  the  Products,  provided                            further  than any increase in price based upon market                            demand   shall   not  be  so  great  as  to   deprive                            Distributor  of  its  normal  and  customary   profit                            margin.

The term of this  Agreement  shall be ten (10)                            years (the \"Term\")  which shall  commence on the date                            upon which the Company  delivers to  Distributor  the                            last Sample, as defined  hereinafter.

Company  shall  promote  and                            advertise the Products generally, at its own expense,                            and   shall   furnish   Distributor   copies  at  all                            advertisement and promotional materials.\n\n                  1.5      The Distributor's Obligation.

In                            order  to  maintain  the  exclusive  rights  to sell,                            lease, distribute and service Products in the Market,                            the Distributor must use all commercially  reasonably                            efforts to purchase for sale to  subdistributors  the                            following minimum quantities of the Products from the                            Company:\n\n         On the  commencement of the Term  Distributor will issue to the Company an  irrevocable  letter of credit (\"LC\") in the amount of Five Hundred  Thousand Dollars  ($500,000),  the form of which is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A and incorporated  herein by reference.  The LC shall have a two (2) month term,  and shall be renewed  for five (5)  consecutive  bimonthly  periods.  A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.  The Company may draw funds from the LC to pay for  Distributor's  purchases,  which are not paid according to the terms in Section 2.7. Prices for the EnergySaver units are\n\n                                    Page -2-\n\nprovided  by the  Company as Exhibit C. The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.       PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS\n\n         2.1      Orders.  The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.  Other than \"drop ship\"  deliveries,  all deliveries\n\n\n\n\n\n                  made  pursuant to this  Agreement  shall be FOB the  Company's                   facilities  located within the continental  United States by a                   carrier authorized by the Distributor.\n\n         2.4.

The term of this  Agreement  shall be ten (10)                            years (the \"Term\")  which shall  commence on the date                            upon which the Company  delivers to  Distributor  the                            last Sample, as defined  hereinafter.

Company  shall  promote  and                            advertise the Products generally, at its own expense,                            and   shall   furnish   Distributor   copies  at  all                            advertisement and promotional materials.\n\n                  1.5      The Distributor's Obligation.

In                            order  to  maintain  the  exclusive  rights  to sell,                            lease, distribute and service Products in the Market,                            the Distributor must use all commercially  reasonably                            efforts to purchase for sale to  subdistributors  the                            following minimum quantities of the Products from the                            Company:\n\n         On the  commencement of the Term  Distributor will issue to the Company an  irrevocable  letter of credit (\"LC\") in the amount of Five Hundred  Thousand Dollars  ($500,000),  the form of which is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A and incorporated  herein by reference.

A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.  The Company may draw funds from the LC to pay for  Distributor's  purchases,  which are not paid according to the terms in Section 2.7. Prices for the EnergySaver units are\n\n                                    Page -2-\n\nprovided  by the  Company as Exhibit C. The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.       PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS\n\n         2.1      Orders.  The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement.

In                            order  to  maintain  the  exclusive  rights  to sell,                            lease, distribute and service Products in the Market,                            the Distributor must use all commercially  reasonably                            efforts to purchase for sale to  subdistributors  the                            following minimum quantities of the Products from the                            Company:\n\n         On the  commencement of the Term  Distributor will issue to the Company an  irrevocable  letter of credit (\"LC\") in the amount of Five Hundred  Thousand Dollars  ($500,000),  the form of which is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A and incorporated  herein by reference.

A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.  The Company may draw funds from the LC to pay for  Distributor's  purchases,  which are not paid according to the terms in Section 2.7. Prices for the EnergySaver units are\n\n                                    Page -2-\n\nprovided  by the  Company as Exhibit C. The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.

The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.       PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS\n\n         2.1      Orders.  The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.  Other than \"drop ship\"  deliveries,  all deliveries\n\n\n\n\n\n                  made  pursuant to this  Agreement  shall be FOB the  Company's                   facilities  located within the continental  United States by a                   carrier authorized by the Distributor.\n\n         2.4.

The Company  also  reserves  the right to                            increase  or  decrease  the price  per unit  based on                            Company   wide   changes   in  unit   prices  to  all                            distributors of the Company,  provided however,  that                            any price changes, other than those based on the CPI,                            shall be uniformly applied to all distributors of the                            Products   and  shall   reasonably   applied  to  all                            distributors  of the  Products  and shall  reasonably                            reflect Company's costs of manufacturing the Products                            and/or  market  demand  for  the  Products,  provided                            further  than any increase in price based upon market                            demand   shall   not  be  so  great  as  to   deprive                            Distributor  of  its  normal  and  customary   profit                            margin.  The Company agrees to exercise this right in                            good faith,  and  consider all  circumstances  of the                            Distributor  and the  Company.

Company  shall  promote  and                            advertise the Products generally, at its own expense,                            and   shall   furnish   Distributor   copies  at  all                            advertisement and promotional materials.\n\n                  1.5      The Distributor's Obligation. The Distributor, at its                            own expense,  shall promote the distribution,  sales,                            and use of Products in the Market.\n\n                  1.6      Distributor's  Terms  and  Minimum  Expectations.  In                            order  to  maintain  the  exclusive  rights  to sell,                            lease, distribute and service Products in the Market,                            the Distributor must use all commercially  reasonably                            efforts to purchase for sale to  subdistributors  the                            following minimum quantities of the Products from the                            Company:\n\n         On the  commencement of the Term  Distributor will issue to the Company an  irrevocable  letter of credit (\"LC\") in the amount of Five Hundred  Thousand Dollars  ($500,000),  the form of which is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A and incorporated  herein by reference.  The LC shall have a two (2) month term,  and shall be renewed  for five (5)  consecutive  bimonthly  periods.  A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.  The Company may draw funds from the LC to pay for  Distributor's  purchases,  which are not paid according to the terms in Section 2.7. Prices for the EnergySaver units are\n\n                                    Page -2-\n\nprovided  by the  Company as Exhibit C. The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.

The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.  Other than \"drop ship\"  deliveries,  all deliveries\n\n\n\n\n\n                  made  pursuant to this  Agreement  shall be FOB the  Company's                   facilities  located within the continental  United States by a                   carrier authorized by the Distributor.\n\n         2.4.

The term of this  Agreement  shall be ten (10)                            years (the \"Term\")  which shall  commence on the date                            upon which the Company  delivers to  Distributor  the                            last Sample, as defined  hereinafter.

Company shall sell and deliver                            as  provided  in  Section  2.3 of this  Agreement  to                            Distributor  on the  price  terms  set  forth in this                            Agreement  or as  amended  from  time  to  time  such                            quantity of Products as Distributor from time to time                            orders  from  Company.   Company  shall  promote  and                            advertise the Products generally, at its own expense,                            and   shall   furnish   Distributor   copies  at  all                            advertisement and promotional materials.\n\n                  1.5      The Distributor's Obligation. The Distributor, at its                            own expense,  shall promote the distribution,  sales,                            and use of Products in the Market.\n\n                  1.6      Distributor's  Terms  and  Minimum  Expectations.  In                            order  to  maintain  the  exclusive  rights  to sell,                            lease, distribute and service Products in the Market,                            the Distributor must use all commercially  reasonably                            efforts to purchase for sale to  subdistributors  the                            following minimum quantities of the Products from the                            Company:\n\n         On the  commencement of the Term  Distributor will issue to the Company an  irrevocable  letter of credit (\"LC\") in the amount of Five Hundred  Thousand Dollars  ($500,000),  the form of which is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A and incorporated  herein by reference.  The LC shall have a two (2) month term,  and shall be renewed  for five (5)  consecutive  bimonthly  periods.  A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.  The Company may draw funds from the LC to pay for  Distributor's  purchases,  which are not paid according to the terms in Section 2.7. Prices for the EnergySaver units are\n\n                                    Page -2-\n\nprovided  by the  Company as Exhibit C. The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.

The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.  Other than \"drop ship\"  deliveries,  all deliveries\n\n\n\n\n\n                  made  pursuant to this  Agreement  shall be FOB the  Company's                   facilities  located within the continental  United States by a                   carrier authorized by the Distributor.\n\n         2.4.

The Company  also  reserves  the right to                            increase  or  decrease  the price  per unit  based on                            Company   wide   changes   in  unit   prices  to  all                            distributors of the Company,  provided however,  that                            any price changes, other than those based on the CPI,                            shall be uniformly applied to all distributors of the                            Products   and  shall   reasonably   applied  to  all                            distributors  of the  Products  and shall  reasonably                            reflect Company's costs of manufacturing the Products                            and/or  market  demand  for  the  Products,  provided                            further  than any increase in price based upon market                            demand   shall   not  be  so  great  as  to   deprive                            Distributor  of  its  normal  and  customary   profit                            margin.  The Company agrees to exercise this right in                            good faith,  and  consider all  circumstances  of the                            Distributor  and the  Company.

The term of this  Agreement  shall be ten (10)                            years (the \"Term\")  which shall  commence on the date                            upon which the Company  delivers to  Distributor  the                            last Sample, as defined  hereinafter.

Company  shall  promote  and                            advertise the Products generally, at its own expense,                            and   shall   furnish   Distributor   copies  at  all                            advertisement and promotional materials.\n\n                  1.5      The Distributor's Obligation.

In                            order  to  maintain  the  exclusive  rights  to sell,                            lease, distribute and service Products in the Market,                            the Distributor must use all commercially  reasonably                            efforts to purchase for sale to  subdistributors  the                            following minimum quantities of the Products from the                            Company:\n\n         On the  commencement of the Term  Distributor will issue to the Company an  irrevocable  letter of credit (\"LC\") in the amount of Five Hundred  Thousand Dollars  ($500,000),  the form of which is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A and incorporated  herein by reference.  The LC shall have a two (2) month term,  and shall be renewed  for five (5)  consecutive  bimonthly  periods.  A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.

Prices for the EnergySaver units are\n\n                                    Page -2-\n\nprovided  by the  Company as Exhibit C. The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.

The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.

The Company  also  reserves  the right to                            increase  or  decrease  the price  per unit  based on                            Company   wide   changes   in  unit   prices  to  all                            distributors of the Company,  provided however,  that                            any price changes, other than those based on the CPI,                            shall be uniformly applied to all distributors of the                            Products   and  shall   reasonably   applied  to  all                            distributors  of the  Products  and shall  reasonably                            reflect Company's costs of manufacturing the Products                            and/or  market  demand  for  the  Products,  provided                            further  than any increase in price based upon market                            demand   shall   not  be  so  great  as  to   deprive                            Distributor  of  its  normal  and  customary   profit                            margin.

The term of this  Agreement  shall be ten (10)                            years (the \"Term\")  which shall  commence on the date                            upon which the Company  delivers to  Distributor  the                            last Sample, as defined  hereinafter.

Company  shall  promote  and                            advertise the Products generally, at its own expense,                            and   shall   furnish   Distributor   copies  at  all                            advertisement and promotional materials.\n\n                  1.5      The Distributor's Obligation.

In                            order  to  maintain  the  exclusive  rights  to sell,                            lease, distribute and service Products in the Market,                            the Distributor must use all commercially  reasonably                            efforts to purchase for sale to  subdistributors  the                            following minimum quantities of the Products from the                            Company:\n\n         On the  commencement of the Term  Distributor will issue to the Company an  irrevocable  letter of credit (\"LC\") in the amount of Five Hundred  Thousand Dollars  ($500,000),  the form of which is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A and incorporated  herein by reference.  The LC shall have a two (2) month term,  and shall be renewed  for five (5)  consecutive  bimonthly  periods.  A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.  The Company may draw funds from the LC to pay for  Distributor's  purchases,  which are not paid according to the terms in Section 2.7. Prices for the EnergySaver units are\n\n                                    Page -2-\n\nprovided  by the  Company as Exhibit C. The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.       PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS\n\n         2.1      Orders.  The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.

A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.  The Company may draw funds from the LC to pay for  Distributor's  purchases,  which are not paid according to the terms in Section 2.7. Prices for the EnergySaver units are\n\n                                    Page -2-\n\nprovided  by the  Company as Exhibit C. The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.       PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS\n\n         2.1      Orders.

Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.

The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.  Other than \"drop ship\"  deliveries,  all deliveries\n\n\n\n\n\n                  made  pursuant to this  Agreement  shall be FOB the  Company's                   facilities  located within the continental  United States by a                   carrier authorized by the Distributor.\n\n         2.4.

The Company  also  reserves  the right to                            increase  or  decrease  the price  per unit  based on                            Company   wide   changes   in  unit   prices  to  all                            distributors of the Company,  provided however,  that                            any price changes, other than those based on the CPI,                            shall be uniformly applied to all distributors of the                            Products   and  shall   reasonably   applied  to  all                            distributors  of the  Products  and shall  reasonably                            reflect Company's costs of manufacturing the Products                            and/or  market  demand  for  the  Products,  provided                            further  than any increase in price based upon market                            demand   shall   not  be  so  great  as  to   deprive                            Distributor  of  its  normal  and  customary   profit                            margin.  The Company agrees to exercise this right in                            good faith,  and  consider all  circumstances  of the                            Distributor  and the  Company.

In                            order  to  maintain  the  exclusive  rights  to sell,                            lease, distribute and service Products in the Market,                            the Distributor must use all commercially  reasonably                            efforts to purchase for sale to  subdistributors  the                            following minimum quantities of the Products from the                            Company:\n\n         On the  commencement of the Term  Distributor will issue to the Company an  irrevocable  letter of credit (\"LC\") in the amount of Five Hundred  Thousand Dollars  ($500,000),  the form of which is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A and incorporated  herein by reference.  The LC shall have a two (2) month term,  and shall be renewed  for five (5)  consecutive  bimonthly  periods.  A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.  The Company may draw funds from the LC to pay for  Distributor's  purchases,  which are not paid according to the terms in Section 2.7. Prices for the EnergySaver units are\n\n                                    Page -2-\n\nprovided  by the  Company as Exhibit C. The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.       PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS\n\n         2.1      Orders.  The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.  Other than \"drop ship\"  deliveries,  all deliveries\n\n\n\n\n\n                  made  pursuant to this  Agreement  shall be FOB the  Company's                   facilities  located within the continental  United States by a                   carrier authorized by the Distributor.\n\n         2.4.

The Company  also  reserves  the right to                            increase  or  decrease  the price  per unit  based on                            Company   wide   changes   in  unit   prices  to  all                            distributors of the Company,  provided however,  that                            any price changes, other than those based on the CPI,                            shall be uniformly applied to all distributors of the                            Products   and  shall   reasonably   applied  to  all                            distributors  of the  Products  and shall  reasonably                            reflect Company's costs of manufacturing the Products                            and/or  market  demand  for  the  Products,  provided                            further  than any increase in price based upon market                            demand   shall   not  be  so  great  as  to   deprive                            Distributor  of  its  normal  and  customary   profit                            margin.  The Company agrees to exercise this right in                            good faith,  and  consider all  circumstances  of the                            Distributor  and the  Company.

All renewals of this  Agreement  shall be on the same                            terms and conditions as are set forth herein.\n\n                  1.4      Company's Obligation.  Company shall sell and deliver                            as  provided  in  Section  2.3 of this  Agreement  to                            Distributor  on the  price  terms  set  forth in this                            Agreement  or as  amended  from  time  to  time  such                            quantity of Products as Distributor from time to time                            orders  from  Company.   Company  shall  promote  and                            advertise the Products generally, at its own expense,                            and   shall   furnish   Distributor   copies  at  all                            advertisement and promotional materials.\n\n                  1.5      The Distributor's Obligation. The Distributor, at its                            own expense,  shall promote the distribution,  sales,                            and use of Products in the Market.\n\n                  1.6      Distributor's  Terms  and  Minimum  Expectations.  In                            order  to  maintain  the  exclusive  rights  to sell,                            lease, distribute and service Products in the Market,                            the Distributor must use all commercially  reasonably                            efforts to purchase for sale to  subdistributors  the                            following minimum quantities of the Products from the                            Company:\n\n         On the  commencement of the Term  Distributor will issue to the Company an  irrevocable  letter of credit (\"LC\") in the amount of Five Hundred  Thousand Dollars  ($500,000),  the form of which is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A and incorporated  herein by reference.  The LC shall have a two (2) month term,  and shall be renewed  for five (5)  consecutive  bimonthly  periods.  A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.  The Company may draw funds from the LC to pay for  Distributor's  purchases,  which are not paid according to the terms in Section 2.7. Prices for the EnergySaver units are\n\n                                    Page -2-\n\nprovided  by the  Company as Exhibit C. The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.       PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS\n\n         2.1      Orders.  The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.  Other than \"drop ship\"  deliveries,  all deliveries\n\n\n\n\n\n                  made  pursuant to this  Agreement  shall be FOB the  Company's                   facilities  located within the continental  United States by a                   carrier authorized by the Distributor.\n\n         2.4.

The Company  also  reserves  the right to                            increase  or  decrease  the price  per unit  based on                            Company   wide   changes   in  unit   prices  to  all                            distributors of the Company,  provided however,  that                            any price changes, other than those based on the CPI,                            shall be uniformly applied to all distributors of the                            Products   and  shall   reasonably   applied  to  all                            distributors  of the  Products  and shall  reasonably                            reflect Company's costs of manufacturing the Products                            and/or  market  demand  for  the  Products,  provided                            further  than any increase in price based upon market                            demand   shall   not  be  so  great  as  to   deprive                            Distributor  of  its  normal  and  customary   profit                            margin.  The Company agrees to exercise this right in                            good faith,  and  consider all  circumstances  of the                            Distributor  and the  Company.

The term of this  Agreement  shall be ten (10)                            years (the \"Term\")  which shall  commence on the date                            upon which the Company  delivers to  Distributor  the                            last Sample, as defined  hereinafter.

Company  shall  promote  and                            advertise the Products generally, at its own expense,                            and   shall   furnish   Distributor   copies  at  all                            advertisement and promotional materials.\n\n                  1.5      The Distributor's Obligation.

In                            order  to  maintain  the  exclusive  rights  to sell,                            lease, distribute and service Products in the Market,                            the Distributor must use all commercially  reasonably                            efforts to purchase for sale to  subdistributors  the                            following minimum quantities of the Products from the                            Company:\n\n         On the  commencement of the Term  Distributor will issue to the Company an  irrevocable  letter of credit (\"LC\") in the amount of Five Hundred  Thousand Dollars  ($500,000),  the form of which is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A and incorporated  herein by reference.  The LC shall have a two (2) month term,  and shall be renewed  for five (5)  consecutive  bimonthly  periods.  A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.  The Company may draw funds from the LC to pay for  Distributor's  purchases,  which are not paid according to the terms in Section 2.7. Prices for the EnergySaver units are\n\n                                    Page -2-\n\nprovided  by the  Company as Exhibit C. The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.

The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.  Other than \"drop ship\"  deliveries,  all deliveries\n\n\n\n\n\n                  made  pursuant to this  Agreement  shall be FOB the  Company's                   facilities  located within the continental  United States by a                   carrier authorized by the Distributor.\n\n         2.4.

The Company  also  reserves  the right to                            increase  or  decrease  the price  per unit  based on                            Company   wide   changes   in  unit   prices  to  all                            distributors of the Company,  provided however,  that                            any price changes, other than those based on the CPI,                            shall be uniformly applied to all distributors of the                            Products   and  shall   reasonably   applied  to  all                            distributors  of the  Products  and shall  reasonably                            reflect Company's costs of manufacturing the Products                            and/or  market  demand  for  the  Products,  provided                            further  than any increase in price based upon market                            demand   shall   not  be  so  great  as  to   deprive                            Distributor  of  its  normal  and  customary   profit                            margin.

A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.

The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.

All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.

The prices set forth in                            Section   2.4(a)  shall  be  subject  to   adjustment                            annually  on the  first  day  of  each  Product  Year                            beginning in the calendar  year 2000 and on the first                            day of each succeeding Product Year for the remainder                            of the Term and all  renewals  of this  Agreement  in                            proportion   to  the  increase  or  decrease  in  the                            Consumer  Price Index (CPI) as compared to the CPI as                            it  existed  on the  first  day of the  Term  of this                            Agreement.  The Company  also  reserves  the right to                            increase  or  decrease  the price  per unit  based on                            Company   wide   changes   in  unit   prices  to  all                            distributors of the Company,  provided however,  that                            any price changes, other than those based on the CPI,                            shall be uniformly applied to all distributors of the                            Products   and  shall   reasonably   applied  to  all                            distributors  of the  Products  and shall  reasonably                            reflect Company's costs of manufacturing the Products                            and/or  market  demand  for  the  Products,  provided                            further  than any increase in price based upon market                            demand   shall   not  be  so  great  as  to   deprive                            Distributor  of  its  normal  and  customary   profit                            margin.

The term of this  Agreement  shall be ten (10)                            years (the \"Term\")  which shall  commence on the date                            upon which the Company  delivers to  Distributor  the                            last Sample, as defined  hereinafter.

Company  shall  promote  and                            advertise the Products generally, at its own expense,                            and   shall   furnish   Distributor   copies  at  all                            advertisement and promotional materials.\n\n                  1.5      The Distributor's Obligation.

In                            order  to  maintain  the  exclusive  rights  to sell,                            lease, distribute and service Products in the Market,                            the Distributor must use all commercially  reasonably                            efforts to purchase for sale to  subdistributors  the                            following minimum quantities of the Products from the                            Company:\n\n         On the  commencement of the Term  Distributor will issue to the Company an  irrevocable  letter of credit (\"LC\") in the amount of Five Hundred  Thousand Dollars  ($500,000),  the form of which is  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A and incorporated  herein by reference.  The LC shall have a two (2) month term,  and shall be renewed  for five (5)  consecutive  bimonthly  periods.  A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.  The Company may draw funds from the LC to pay for  Distributor's  purchases,  which are not paid according to the terms in Section 2.7. Prices for the EnergySaver units are\n\n                                    Page -2-\n\nprovided  by the  Company as Exhibit C. The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.       PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS\n\n         2.1      Orders.  The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement. The                   Company  may refuse to accept a purchase  order on the grounds                   that it cannot meet the delivery schedule therein, and if as a                   result  of  such  failure  or  delay   Distributor  loses  its                   customer's  orders  for those  Products,  the  number of units                   which  Distributor  ordered but were not timely  delivered  to                   Distributor  or to  Distributor's  customer  will be  credited                   against   Distributor's   minimum.   Distributor   shall  make                   reasonable  efforts  to notify  the  Company  of the  proposed                   delivery  schedule before accepting a customer order and shall                   give the  Company  written  notice  of any  customer  purchase                   orders which  imposes  liability for late shipment and neither                   the  Distributor  nor the Company  shall have a liability  for                   consequential  or  liquidated   damages   pertaining  to  late                   delivery unless Company  specifically  acknowledges and agrees                   in  writing  to the  same.  The  Distributor  agrees  that the                   Company  shall not be liable for its failure to perform due to                   any  occurrence  beyond  the  Company's   reasonable  control,                   including, but not limited to, acts of God, fires,\n\n                                    Page -4-\n\n                  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in  shipping  beyond the                   Company's  control,  labor strikes other than strikes  against                   the Company itself,  weather conditions or foreign or domestic                   government  regulation  or authority  which  directly  affects                   Company's ability to deliver Product.\n\n         2.3      Delivery.  Other than \"drop ship\"  deliveries,  all deliveries\n\n\n\n\n\n                  made  pursuant to this  Agreement  shall be FOB the  Company's                   facilities  located within the continental  United States by a                   carrier authorized by the Distributor.\n\n         2.4.

The term of this  Agreement  shall be ten (10)                            years (the \"Term\")  which shall  commence on the date                            upon which the Company  delivers to  Distributor  the                            last Sample, as defined  hereinafter.

A minimum of a $250,000.00  purchase  order  must be  received  by Company by the first of each month for a total (12) month  period.

Prices for the EnergySaver units are\n\n                                    Page -2-\n\nprovided  by the  Company as Exhibit C. The  Company  will be  entitled  to draw against the LC pursuant to the terms of the LC.\n\n                  (A)    375 units in the first Product Year (1999)\n\n                  (B)    750 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2000)\n\n                  (C)    937 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2001)\n\n                  (D)    1,171 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2002)\n\n                  (E)    1,463 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2003)\n\n                  (F)    1,828 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2004)\n\n                  (G)    2,285 units in the next succeeding Product Year; (2005)\n\n                  (H)    2,856  unit each in the lat  three  years of                          the initial Term of this  Agreement  and any                          renewals thereof.\n\n         For purposes of this Agreement, a Product Year shall be the twelve (12) month period  following the  commencement  of the initial Term of this Agreement and each twelve  (12)  months  thereafter.  Distributor's  expected  sales shall include the purchase of the Samples as defined hereinafter.\n\n         Sales in excess of the  expected  sales  which are  actually  made in a Product Year may be applied to meet the  expectations for the next Product Year. Any such carry-over from one year to the next Product Year may not be considered in determining  whether there is a carry-over from that next Product Year. Thus, by way of example and not limitation,  if there was an expectation of 50 in year one and 200 for  year two and 60 units  are sold in year one and 195  units  are sold in year two,  the  expectation  for year two will have been met,  but there will be no carry-over to year three. If the  Distributor  shall fail to purchase the minimum number of units in any year, the  Distributor's  exclusive rights to sell and distribute the Product in the Market,  may at Company's sole option, be reevaluated.\n\n         Company  agrees  that  Distributor  shall not be liable or  subject  to reevaluation  for  failure to meet  expectations  due to any  occurrence  beyond Distributor's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, Acts of God, fires,  floods,  wars,  sabotage,  accidents  in shipping,  labor  disturbances,\n\n\n\n\n\nweather conditions,  governmental regulation, lack of Company performance, delay by  Company,  failure of Company to honor  warranties  or  otherwise  materially support the Products.\n\n         The aggregate  units to be sold on an annual basis  described above are for the Illinois distributorship on an aggregate basis.\n\n         1.7      Relationship of Parties.  The relationship between the Company                   and the Distributor\n\n                                    Page -3-\n\n                  is that of vendor and vendee.  This  Agreement does not create                   the  relationship  of principal  and agent between the Company                   and the Distributor for any purpose whatsoever. This Agreement                   shall not be construed as constituting the Distributor and the                   Company as partners, joint venturers, or as creating any other                   form of legal  association or  arrangement  which would impose                   liability  upon one party for the act or omission of the other                   party.  Neither  party is granted any express or implied right                   of  authority  by the other  party to assume or to create  any                   obligation  or  responsibility  on behalf of or in the name of                   the other  party,  or to bind the other party in any manner or                   thing whatsoever.\n\n2.       PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS\n\n         2.1      Orders.  The Distributor shall order Products from the Company                   on a purchase  order form  mutually  acceptable to the Company                   and Distributor and which is consistent with Exhibit B hereto,                   and  which  incorporates  the  terms  and  provisions  of this                   Distributor  Agreement.  The  Distributor  shall  not order or                   purchase Products from any source other than the Company.  All                   orders shall be subject to acceptance and  confirmation by the                   Company.  Distributor  may  cancel an order  that is  properly                   cancelled by  Distributor's  customer,  unless the Company has                   commenced  production  which is in any way customized for that                   customer.  The Distributor  shall annually provide the Company                   with a  non-binding  forecast of orders for  Products  for the                   succeeding 12-month period.\n\n         2.2      Shipment.  The  Company  and  the  Distributor  shall  jointly                   determine  shipment dates.  The Company shall use commercially                   reasonable  efforts to ship  promptly  all orders for Products                   received from the Distributor. In addition to any other remedy                   which this Agreement provides to Distributor  against Company,                   if Company fails to deliver or delays in  delivering  Products                   as were  ordered by  Distributor  within 45 days  after  their                   required  delivery date, and if as a result of such failure or                   delay  Distributor  loses  its  customer's  orders  for  those                   Products,  the number of units which  Distributor  ordered but                   were not timely  delivered to Distributor or to  Distributor's                   customer  will  be  credited  against   Distributor's  minimum                   expectation as specified on Section 1.6 of this Agreement.

    "# Key Insights from CUAD Dataset Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Structure\n",
    "- **Total Documents:** 510 unique legal contracts\n",
    "- **Total Clause Types:** 41 different legal clause categories\n",
    "- **Total Questions/Contexts:** 20,910 question-context pairs\n",
    "- **Data Format:** Question-answering format where each clause type is a question about contract content\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class Imbalance Analysis\n",
    "- **Overall Clause Presence:** 32.1% of questions have corresponding clauses present (6,702 out of 20,910)\n",
    "- **Highly Imbalanced Distribution:**\n",
    "    - **Perfect Presence (100%):** Document Name (510/510)\n",
    "    - **Very High Presence (>90%):** Parties (99.8% - 509/510), Agreement Date (92.2% - 470/510)\n",
    "    - **Common Clauses (>50%):** Governing Law (85.7% - 437/510), Expiration Date (81.0% - 413/510), Effective Date (76.5% - 390/510)\n",
    "    - **Rare Clauses (<10%):** 9 clause types including Source Code Escrow (2.5% - 13/510), Price Restrictions (2.9% - 15/510), Joint IP Ownership (9.0% - 46/510)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Document Variety\n",
    "- **Clause Rate Distribution:** Documents vary significantly in clause density\n",
    "    - **Mean clause rate per document:** 46.3%\n",
    "    - **Range:** From 7.3% to 58.5% clause presence across documents\n",
    "    - **Document Length Variation:** Total document lengths range from ~376K to 7.2M characters\n",
    "    - **Contract Types:** Diverse contract categories (distributor agreements, endorsement agreements, licensing, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Text Characteristics\n",
    "- **Context Length Distribution:**\n",
    "    - Mean context length: ~4,800 characters\n",
    "    - Wide variation in paragraph/context sizes\n",
    "    - Some contexts are very long (legal document complexity)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Answer/Clause Length Distribution:**\n",
    "    - Mean answer length: ~254 characters\n",
    "    - Median answer length: 212 characters\n",
    "    - Answers represent specific clause spans within contexts\n",
    "    - Range from very short clauses (10 characters) to very long ones (>1000 characters)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Challenges for ML Models\n",
    "1. **Severe Class Imbalance:** Many clause types are extremely rare (9 types <10% presence)\n",

    "## Recommendations for Model Development\n",
    "- Use stratified sampling to handle class imbalance, especially for the 9 rare clause types\n",
    "- Consider focal loss or class weighting techniques to address the 32.1% vs 67.9% imbalance\n",
    "- Implement hierarchical or sliding window approaches for long contexts (mean ~4,800 chars)\n",
    "- Fine-tune on legal domain data given specialized terminology\n",
    "- Use ensemble methods to handle rare clause detection (particularly for <10% presence types)\n",
    "- Consider different thresholds for different clause types based on their prevalence patterns"
