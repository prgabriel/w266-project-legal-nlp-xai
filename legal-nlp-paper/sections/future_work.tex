There's still so much to explore here. Most contracts are way longer than what these models can handle in one go, so I'm working on better ways to process full documents without missing the important stuff. The class imbalance problem is brutal too; some clauses barely show up in the training data, and the model basically ignores them. I'm thinking about trying some few-shot learning techniques or maybe building separate models for rare clause types. On the explainability side, lawyers keep asking for explanations that actually match how they think about contracts—not just which words the model liked, but how different clauses relate to each other and why certain combinations matter. And honestly, the biggest challenge isn't even technical—it's figuring out how to get this stuff into actual law firms where people are still using Word docs from 2003 and printing everything out. Beyond commercial contracts, this approach could work for all kinds of legal documents, but right now I just want to make sure it doesn't mess up on the contracts it's already supposed to handle.
