Building this explainable AI framework for contract analysis has been a wild ride. I went in thinking I'd just train some models and call it a day, but it turns out that getting lawyers to actually trust AI is way harder than getting the AI to work in the first place. The whole explainability thing became my obsession—not because it's trendy, but because without it, this whole project would've been useless. No lawyer is going to stake their career on a black box that spits out predictions.

Look, there's still a ton of stuff to figure out. The class imbalance problem is brutal, legal documents are still a nightmare to parse, and don't even get me started on trying to handle contracts that look like someone photocopied them underwater. But I really think we're onto something here—when you combine models that actually understand legal language with tools that can explain what they're doing, you get something lawyers might actually want to use. This whole project completely changed how I think about AI in legal work. Turns out, building the tech is the easy part—the hard part is building something lawyers will actually trust with their careers.
